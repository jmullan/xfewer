FEATURES:
   Display either the file(s) specified on the command line or input from
      standard input, supplied by a pipe.  File/pipe may be optionally
      monitored so that the display is continuously updated as new text is
      added.
   Display new files in the current window or by creating a new window.
   Reload or print the displayed file.
   Search the displayed file using either exact, case-insensitive, or
      regular expression patterns.
   Edit the displayed file with your favorite editor (as specified in
      the VISUAL or EDITOR environment variable)

AVAILABLE FROM:
   ftp.cs.berkeley.edu:/ucb/people/dglo/xfewer/xfewer-1.7.tar.gz
   ftp.x.org:/contrib/applications/xfewer-1.7.tar.gz

TESTED ON:
   SunOS 4.1.3
   Ultrix 4.2
   HP-UX 9.01
   OSF/1 1.3

INSTALLATION:
   Check the Imakefile to see if you need to add or change any DEFINES,
   then do the usual 'xmkmf', etc.

CAVEAT:
   The color resources are stored in the global app-defaults directory in
   a file named 'XFewer-color'.  If you have a color display and are running
   at least X11R5, you may want to add a line like this to your personal
   resources file:

	#ifdef COLOR
	*customization: -color
	#endif

   Versions of X earlier than X11R5 don't support the `customization'
   resource.  If you're on one of those, you'll have to include the color
   resources in your personal resources file.
